description:
  The types from this library are intended to be used with
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
  mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information, sending requests,
  and receiving responses.
  .
  Lenses are used for constructing and manipulating types,
  due to the depth of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
  such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
  .
  See "Network.AWS.AWSHealth" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS documentation>
  to get started.
